# Custmomer-Churn
This project is focused on Marketing Data Analytics. I was tasked with the responsibility of building a predictive model to find out if a customer will churn or not churn. At the end of the project, the management was able to identify the percentage of customers that churn and the percentage of customers that do not churn.

My predictions helped the management to better understand the key characteristics features that are responsible for customer churn. The insights generated from this predictive analytics helps the management to know what to do to ensure that the percentage of customer churn is reduced, thus, improving the value of the organisation. 

Skill sets acquired through these projects includes the following: 
Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas package in Python;
Data Cleaning, Processing, Preprocessing, and Feature Engineering;
Customer Churn or no Churn Prediction using Ensemble models (Stacking),  logistics regression model, and;
Data Insights and Presentation using Microsoft Power BI.
